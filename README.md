# ISS-tracking-map

### About 
This map is tracking the position of ISS(international space setallite) at every 1 second.
I use Nasa's "where the iss" API and "Leaflet.js" for the map.

### What I have learned
          1. Leaflet.js : Javascript map libery
          2. Show fetched data from API every second with setInterval() method
